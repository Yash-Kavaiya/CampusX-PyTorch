# PyTorch Training Pipeline

# Neural Network Implementation from Scratch 🧠

## Project Overview 🎯
We'll build a neural network for breast cancer detection, implementing core deep learning concepts from scratch while following PyTorch-style patterns. Let's break this down into manageable components!



## Code Structure Breakdown 📋

### 1. Layer Components 🔨

- **Layer Class**: Implements linear transformation (Wx + b)
  - Forward pass: Matrix multiplication and bias addition
  - Backward pass: Gradient computation for weights and biases
  
- **Activation Functions**:
  - ReLU: max(0, x) for hidden layers
  - Sigmoid: 1/(1 + e^(-x)) for binary classification output

### 2. Model Architecture 🏗️

```python
BinaryClassifier:
    Input Layer → ReLU → Hidden Layer → Sigmoid → Output
```

### 3. Training Process 🔄

1. **Forward Pass**:
   - Data flows through layers
   - Activations computed sequentially
   
2. **Loss Calculation**:
   - Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
   - Handles binary classification task

3. **Backward Pass**:
   - Gradient computation
   - Chain rule application
   
4. **Parameter Updates**:
   - Simple gradient descent
   - Learning rate controlled updates

Let's run the model!

## Key Features Implemented ✨

1. **Mini-batch Processing**
   - Processes data in smaller batches
   - Improves training stability
   
2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate classes for layers and activations
   - Easy to extend and modify

3. **Gradient-based Learning**
   - Implements backpropagation

### Where Are Tensors Used in Deep Learning?

Tensors are integral to every stage of a deep learning pipeline, from data representation to model training and deployment. Below is a detailed explanation of their use in various aspects of deep learning:

---

### 1. **Data Storage**
Tensors are the primary format for storing and processing training and validation data in deep learning:
- **Image Data**: Images are stored as tensors, with dimensions depending on their color type (grayscale or RGB) and batch size.
  - Example: A batch of 32 RGB images of size \(128 \times 128\) is stored as a 4D tensor with shape **[32, 128, 128, 3]**.
- **Text Data**: Tokenized text sequences are converted into tensors for processing in NLP tasks.
  - Example: A sentence of 10 words, with each word represented by a 300-dimensional embedding, results in a tensor of shape **[10, 300]**.
- **Audio Data**: Waveforms or spectrograms are stored as tensors for tasks like speech recognition.
  - Example: An audio file of 10 seconds sampled at 44.1 kHz is stored as a 1D tensor with **441,000 entries**.

---

### 2. **Weights and Biases**
- The **learnable parameters** of a neural network, such as weights and biases, are stored as tensors.
- These parameters are updated during training using gradient descent or other optimization algorithms.
  
**Example**:
- In a fully connected layer:
  - **Weights Tensor**: Shape **[input_features, output_features]**.
  - **Bias Tensor**: Shape **[output_features]**.

---

### 3. **Matrix Operations**
Deep learning heavily relies on matrix operations, which are efficiently handled by tensors:
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Used in fully connected layers to compute weighted sums.
  - Example: Input tensor multiplied by weights tensor: \( \text{Output} = \text{Input} \cdot \text{Weights} + \text{Bias} \).
- **Dot Products**: Used in similarity computations and attention mechanisms.
- **Broadcasting**: Simplifies operations by expanding smaller tensors to match the dimensions of larger ones.

**Example in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
- A convolution operation is performed using a **4D input tensor** (batch × height × width × channels) and a **4D kernel tensor**.

---

### 4. **Training Process**

#### **Forward Pass**:
- During the forward pass, tensors flow through the layers of the neural network.
- Each layer performs transformations on the input tensors to produce output tensors.
  - Example: Activation functions like ReLU or sigmoid are applied element-wise to tensors.

#### **Backward Pass (Gradient Computation)**:
- Tensors are used to calculate gradients (partial derivatives) of the loss function with respect to the model parameters.
- These gradients are stored as tensors and used to update weights and biases during backpropagation.

**Example**:
- If the loss function \( L \) depends on weights \( W \), gradients \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial W} \) are tensors computed using automatic differentiation.

---

### Additional Uses of Tensors in Deep Learning:
1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Tensors efficiently handle batch operations, enabling parallel processing of multiple data points.
2. **Activation Maps**:
   - Intermediate results in CNNs (e.g., feature maps) are stored as tensors.
3. **Embedding Representations**:
   - Tensors represent embeddings for words, images, or nodes in a graph.
4. **Custom Loss Functions**:
   - Loss functions are computed using tensor operations on predictions and ground truth labels.
